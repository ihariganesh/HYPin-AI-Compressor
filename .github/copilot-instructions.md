# HYPin Compress - Media Compression Web App

This is a React TypeScript web application for compressing images, PDFs, and videos with a futuristic UI design.

## Project Structure

- Built with Vite + React + TypeScript
- Styled with TailwindCSS for futuristic cyberpunk aesthetics
- Uses Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Implements drag-and-drop file uploads with react-dropzone

## Key Technologies

- **Image Compression**: browser-image-compression library
- **PDF Processing**: pdf-lib for PDF manipulation and compression
- **Video Compression**: @ffmpeg/ffmpeg for client-side video processing
- **UI/UX**: TailwindCSS with custom cyberpunk theme, Framer Motion animations
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography

## Design Philosophy

- Cyberpunk/futuristic aesthetic with neon colors (blue, purple, pink)
- Glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur and transparency
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Dark theme with gradient backgrounds

## Compression Levels

- **Low**: 85% quality, faster processing, preserves more detail
- **Medium**: 70% quality, balanced compression and quality
- **High**: 50% quality, maximum compression, smallest file sizes

## File Support

- **Images**: JPG, PNG, WebP, HEIC, GIF, BMP
- **PDFs**: All PDF formats with metadata removal options
- **Videos**: MP4, AVI, MOV, WebM, MKV (with FFmpeg fallback)

When working with this codebase:

- Maintain the cyberpunk aesthetic with neon colors and glass effects
- Use Framer Motion for all animations and transitions
- Follow TypeScript best practices with proper type definitions
- Ensure all components are responsive and accessible
- Use the established color scheme: neon-blue, neon-purple, neon-pink, cyber-dark, cyber-gray
